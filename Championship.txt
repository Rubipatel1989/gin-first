Championship Coach App Analysis (Step-by-Step)
Analysed from Image

Understanding the Problem (Coaching Chaos)
●​ Coaches currently use 5–7+ disconnected apps for:
1.​ Film – game/practice video analysis
2.​ Stats – player and team statistics
3.​ Communication – team messaging, announcements
4.​ Scheduling – practices, games, meetings
5.​ Culture/Leadership – often tracked mentally or informally

The Core Issue Identified
●​ Invisible work gets lost: Important aspects like culture, leadership, effort, and player
buy-in are not systematically tracked.
●​ Players are reduced to stat lines: Their character, academics, and personal growth are
overlooked.

Main App Concept:
A centralized program operating system for sports teams that integrates coaching, player
development, communication, and analytics in one platform.
Goal: Track both measurable stats and intangible aspects like leadership, culture, effort,
academics, and life goals.
